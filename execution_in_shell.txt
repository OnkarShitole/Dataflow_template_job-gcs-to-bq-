 ===========================================
    
        **Python cannot directly run a file from GCS**

Python only runs **local files**, not files on `gs://`. You have two options:

---

### **Option 1: Copy the file locally in Cloud Shell, then run**

```bash
# Copy from GCS to Cloud Shell home directory
gsutil cp gs://my-bucket-88/beampipeline.py ~/beampipeline.py

# Run it locally
python3 ~/beampipeline.py
```

---

### **Option 2: Use Dataflow flex template / staging (recommended for production)**

* You **donâ€™t run the script directly from GCS**. Instead:

  1. Stage your code in GCS (temp\_location)
  2. Submit the pipeline to Dataflow using `DataflowRunner`
  3. Dataflow workers fetch your code from GCS automatically.

Your pipeline code should have something like:

```python
gcp_options.temp_location = 'gs://my-bucket-88/temp'
options.view_as(StandardOptions).runner = 'DataflowRunner'
```

Then you can run locally:

```bash
python3 beampipeline.py
```
